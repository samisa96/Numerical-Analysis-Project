# User-Guide : Numerical-Analysis-Project

This project will allow the user to approximate roots of functions using several methods and to approximate results of matrix.
All roots approxmiates methods will be backup with graphs.
#### Roots approximation methods:
1. The Bisection method.
2. Newton raphson method
3. Secant method.

#### Matrix approximation methods:
1. Gauss Siedle
2. SOR - Successive Over Relaxation

## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites

A work environment that supports Python3, like Pycharm, VS code etc.
