# Numerical_Analysis_Project

This project will allow you to perform calculations for different functions so that you can find their different roots.
The project uses several methods of calculation:

1. The Bisection method.
2. Newton raphson method
3. Secant method.

## Getting Started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.
```
git@github.com:yariv1025/Numerical_Analysis_Project.git
```
After Python installion, open cmd / Terminal and navigate to project folder and run the follow command:
```
python pip install -r install.txt
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

#### Prerequisites

A work environment that supports Python3, like Pycharm, VS code etc.


Built With
----------
* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) -Python IDE.
